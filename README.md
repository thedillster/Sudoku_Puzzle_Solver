# Sudoku_Puzzle_Solver


## Overview of program 

A program developed in python in order to familiarize myself more with the language. The program will take in a Sudoku puzzle and solve it. Devolped through unit testing and manual testing.

## What does it do 

This program will solve a sudoku puzzle (a 2d array). As of right now, the puzzle is hardcoded into the program as a global variable. The solved puzzle is displayed in console. This project is meant to be an ongoing endeavour so there are plans to implement some sort of gui as well as a new way for a sudoku puzzle to be read in and solved by the program (like through a .png). 

## Why did I build this? 

I started this project to give myself some exposure to the **python programming language** and also to help strengthen my **unit testing skills**. 

## Plans for next release 
Optimisation of the program is very much needed as the program is taking far too long to solve a puzzle. Proper variable names are also needed as the readability of the code could be better.
